	A FEW NOTES ON EMBEDDING BUGGRABBER IN YOUR OWN ADDON

BugGrabber will be shortened to "BG" in this document for the sake of
sanity.

1. If BG detects a standalone error catcher, the embedded BG will not
load. Examples include:
!BugGrabber, !ImprovedErrorFrame, !Swatter

2. If there are several addons present that embed BG, only the first
embedded BG will load - there's no versioning support or graceful
upgrades.

3. Embedded BGs will not save their errors to any SV, although all the
APIs should function while running. All errors will obviously be
attributed to session 1. The counter will never increment.

4. Embedded BG will not whine about missing display addons.

5. Do NOT implement the X-BugGrabber-Display TOC field if you embed
BG. It is only for full reimplementations of and alternatives for
BugSack to use.

6. Register for the callback BugGrabber_BugGrabbed, and present the
errors as you see fit.

7. If a display addon is present - there's no API yet to check whether
or not there is - you should not do /anything/ or even register for
the callbacks. For now you can use the following code to check;

local name, _, _, enabled = GetAddOnInfo("BugSack")
if name and enabled then
	-- Don't do anything!
end

The above code will be changed to a BG API, like

if BugGrabber:HasDisplay() then
	-- Don't do anything!
end

At a later point.

That's what I can remember for now, thanks for reading!
